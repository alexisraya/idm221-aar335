        <h1>Calvary Chapel Yorba Linda - A Case Study</h1>
        <p>See the full prototype <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/prototype/CCYL-Website-Prototype-cki6yrqam00251w01a3ja5143/play/e356966c">here</a>!</p>
    
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Calvary Chapel Yorba Linda (CCYL) has had many ups and downs with keeping up with technological updates. They have many issues with keeping a clean, up to date website that promotes the church’s events, gets people involved, and welcomes newcomers. Ccylchurch.com is one of many attempts to have a church website. Their previous attempts have also failed in maintaining engagement with their congregation. They were rarely updated, clunky, and unprofessional for a church setting. Although CCYL has improved through this updated site, there is still a lot of room for improvement.
        </p>
        <!--IMAGE-->
        <p>
            This website is overrun with oversized banners, images, and buttons. The oversized banners deliver an overflow of information to the viewer, making them feel very overwhelmed. The larger banners and images also make it very difficult to find information efficiently. Additionally, the placement of the components also follows an illogical pathway which makes finding information even more difficult and confusing. For example, to find information such as the service times and address of the church, the user must scroll down quite a bit. This is information that should be easily located as it is very important. Despite the issues with this site, what I do enjoy about it is the menu at the top. The menu gives the site a sense of organization and an easy access to all the main pages.
        </p>

        <h2>The User</h2>
        <p>
            This would not be best suited for the typical CCYL member- a middle aged, educated, father who is easily frustrated, somewhat familiar with technology, and enjoys simplicity. They way that I would repurpose CCYL’s website would first be by fixing the home page. I would make the headers and images smaller and reorganize them to follow a logical pattern. In this way, the website would meet its goal of being welcoming to the newcomers. Afterwords, I would do the same process to each page to reach the goal of getting more people involved and informing members of church events.
        </p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            In creating a site map for the church website, a card sort exercise was given to three participants. To resemble the church’s congregation, the participants consisted of one female and two males, all of whom were between the ages of 38 and 45, family oriented, churchgoers, and lived near the church. The exercise consisted of ten cards representing the ten items that make up the website. The group then had to separate the items into categories.
        </p>
        <!--IMAGE-->
        <p>
            Based on the data collected, the participants chose to group the items into three categories. No participants added any items to the list, and they agreed on most of the grouping. For example, given by the similarity matrix, 100% of the participants grouped together “Volunteer Opportunities” and “Events”. None of the results were unexpected as the items grouped together were similar and followed a logical line (i.e. in order to volunteer, a person would have to sign up). In addition, a dendrogram was used to show what proportion of the participants agreed with certain card groupings. Unexpectedly, “Beliefs” became an outlier as there was no agreement as to what it should be grouped with.
        </p>
        <!--IMAGE-->
        <p>
            The sitemap created resembled the dendrogram and had three categories- “About Us”, “Connect”, and “Resources”. “About Us” contained the items that together give an overview of the church. “Beliefs” was placed here because it contributed to the church’s overview. “Connect” contained items that help people get involved with the church. “Resources” contained the items that have outside information that are relevant to the church such as sermons and the church app. This site map provides a middle ground for the participants and the overall church congregation.
        </p>

        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <!--IMAGE-->
        <p>
            The typography and color styles were chosen to welcome the users and give them a sense of livelihood and youth. Saturated purples and bright pinks were chosen to reflect the brightness and youth of the church, without being too overwhelming for the older population, who may have sensitive eyes. The bright pink was used as an accent color to highlight important phrases, such as “you are welcomed here,” and was also used as a hover color to indicate that a certain item was clickable. The darker, saturated purple contrasted the pink and allowed for users not to become too overwhelmed from the brightness given by the pinks, white, and the imagery. The beige was also used to balance out the purple and the pink and helped in tying in the overall color scheme by offsetting the rest of the colors. The lighter purple was used as an accent color that indicated separate categories in the survey.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like the typography and color styles, the wireframes were chosen to welcome the user, find information efficiently, and not give the user a sense of overwhelmingness. This was accomplished in the home page by having areas of text run diagonally across the screen, which helped in separating information. Additionally, the home page was broken up into thirds which also aided in separating information. Trapezoidal images were used in the middle of the page to break up these thirds, balance out the page, and to give the page more youth by not being confirmative to a rectangle. In the connect screen, the largest area, the survey, was given rounded edges to be more welcoming for users to fill out and to contrast the rest of the ridged shapes. The gallery also used the rule of thirds, however, images took up various thirds in order to break up the section. Although these wireframes did have successful aspects, various compositions could have been explored that would have made the site more welcoming and less rigid overall.
        </p>

        <h2>Results and Reflection</h2>
        <!--IMAGE-->
        <p>
            In the original proposed design, the color scheme was very undersaturated and did not welcome the user to the church. In addition, the images used in the connect page did not feel welcoming and looked more like an advertisement as the people in the images were either not smiling or had their back towards the camera. To change this, brighter colors were used and images where people were smiling and facing the camera. In the original wireframes, the elements were very static and rigid. There was no movement throughout the pages. To change this, two large image shapes were changed from rectangles to trapezoids and text overlaid some of the images. In addition, different sized rectangles were used in the image gallery on the connect page. The final prototype was created which integrated all these changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final prototype has been successful in accomplishing the goals. The home page was reorganized to follow a logical pattern of information- the user first sees “Welcome Home” written very largely at the top, this is followed by what the church is about on the center of the page, and finally the church service times on the bottom right of the page. In addition, the site welcomes the user by having the words “Welcome Home” large and in bright pink text. “You are welcomed here” is also in pink text to emphasis this idea of welcomeness. On the connect page, the join button and the sign up buttons seen when hovering over an image are also in pink to lead the user on clicking on them. They are also have rounded edges to be less aggressive and welcome the user to clicking the buttons. The same holds true for the rounded edges on the survey, which also balance out the rigid edges seen on the rest of the page. The final prototype is a stark difference from the original CCYL website and demonstrates a more welcoming and lively church.
