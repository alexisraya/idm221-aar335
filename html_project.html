        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This project is a portfolio site designed for mobile use. It is currently unresponsive, but will become responsive in later versions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, I was tasked with designing a mobile portfolio site and programming it in HTML and CSS.

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
            To start, I used Figma to build wireframes for the site. I decided to go with color ways and design themes that speak to my personality. For example, a brown color scheme was used to give a light feeling to the site and also express my love for coffee. I tried to be as deliberate as possible when considering the design of this site.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            I found this project to be a really interesting challenge as it was my first time programming in HTML and CSS. I really enjoy learning new programming languages on my own time, so this project was very enjoyable for me to do. This project and class also made me want to consider persuing scripting/ frontend programming as a carreer. I'm definitely excited to become more comfortable and learn more HTML and CSS.
