        <h1>HTML/CSS - A Case Study</h1>        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hydrate is an app that allows users to track their water intake and understand their hydration levels by watering a virtual plant throughout the day. This app was modeled after MyWater, which similarly allows users to track their water intake throughout the day and reach a hydration goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, I was tasked with designing and rebranding an app of my choice as well as develop the interactions for the app. This included analyzing the a task flow and app flow of MyWater and developing a high fidelity wireframe, wire flow, IX flow, interaction guides, an an animated prototype for Hydrate. The programs used for this design were Figma and Adobe After Effects.

        <h2>Wireframes and Wire Flow</h2>
        <p>
            After understanding the task and app flow of MyWater, I was then able to develop low fidelity wireframes and a wire flow for my rebranding of the app. I decided to go with the concept of having the user water a plant throughout the day. This way, they could take care of a plant as they take care of their body. This would also give them a better visual queue to if they were staying hydrated throughout the day. A yellow and wilting plant would mean the user was dehydrated, and a green leafy plant would mean that the user was hydrated. To further tie in this aspect, as the user is getting closer to their water goal, the plant would grow to become a fully grown plant. Additionally, I wanted to simplify the step for adding the amount of drink consumed by allowing the user to tap on the numbers on the amount consumed screen rather than tapping on a button to manually input the amount.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            I found this project to be a great exercise and challenge as it was my first time using Adobe After Effects. I really enjoyed how the project allowed me to explore rebranding as well as further understand the function and importance of microinteractions.
