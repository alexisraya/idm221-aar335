        <h3>Hello! I'm Alexis Raya</h3>
    <p> 
        Nice to meet you! I’m a UXID student at Drexel University and I’m planning on also getting a minor in Fine Arts and a masters in Digital Media. I want to explore how to use design to promote a creative and meaningful world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Growing up, my dream was to become and artists and because of that, I immersed myself in art activities. I also became interested in technology and programming. I found that design is my perfect blend of both these worlds and fell in love with the world of UI/UX design and digital media. Throughout my career, I hope to challenge myself to become a better designer as well as deeply explore the design world and digital media.
    </p>
    <p>
        With this exploration, I hope to also inspire and challenge myself and my peers to promote and creative and meaningful world.

    <h3>My Other Interests...</h3>
    <h5>Fine Arts</h5>
    <p>
        Fine arts was the first creative outlet that I was ever introduced to. It has given me the drive to never stop creating and has challenged me to find other ways to create. I enjoy oil painting, watercolors, charcoal drawing, and general sketching. With this interest, I like to explore the human condition and the figure.
    </p>
    <h5>Programming</h5>
    <p>
        I think that programming is another way understanding the world and creating art. I’ve been programming and learning new programming languages for the last 6 years and even had the opportunity to teach children how to code for 3 years. I mostly focus on creating games and creative projects when I program.
    </p>
    <h5>Coffee Brewing</h5>
    <p>
        French press, pour over, cold brew. Over the last few years, I’ve grown very interested in coffee, the industry, and brewing methods. I enjoy exploring different brew methods, supporting local coffee shops, and informing myself on coffee and the ethical issues the surround the industry.
    </p>
    <h5>Plants</h5>
    <p>
        This interest started out as a quarantine interest but quickly grew into one of my favorite pass times. I really enjoy taking care of plants and learning about how to care for them. Back home, I started a garden for my grandma. We’ve grown tomatoes, habaneros, snap peas, cilantro, and much more together. I find that plants and gardening has helped me in becoming more relaxed and environmentally conscious.
