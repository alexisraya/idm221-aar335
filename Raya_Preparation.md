# Document Inspiration

## Site One: *<https://www.jamiejchoi.com/>*

I really enjoy the simplicity of this site. It's pretty cut and try for the most part and I think that Jamie does a good job in making her personality shine through the site without doing too much. I also really enjoy how welcoming the initial homepage is and the illustration of her that goes along with it.

## Site Two: *<http://www.jermshaw.com/>*

I like the layout of the projects for this site. It seems very clean. Although I think that it's cool that the elements move with the scrolling, it makes the about me blurb unreadable. Maybe it's to promote the user to scroll. But I would personally move that somewhere away from the text. Something else I like is how there is a clear and consistent style throughout the site. Each project button gives an idea of what the project is about and feels like the cover of a cool graphic design book.

## Site Three *<https://sinemkurt.com/>*

What I really liked about this site was how she layed out her projects. She doesnt have large amounts of copy and speaks through diagrams and imagery. I think that this makes the project pages easier to read and keeps the user invested in her project. I think that this way of presenting the projects makes it more of a story than a dry presentaiton of a portfolio

## About Me

Hi! My name is Alexis Raya and I'm a second year UXID student at Drexel University. I chose UXID because of my love for both design and technology, and I believed that this major would be a good fit for me. After spending a year in this field, I have grown to love it for more than it's blend of design and technology. It has made me question and seek to create better user experiences and learn more about design. Eventually, I will also be attaining my masters in digital media.

One of my hobbies includes practicing fine arts. I was a fine arts student at Arts Steps Yorba Linda for 15 years. From there, I learned foundational skills in drawing, painting, and observation. It was there that I also discovered my passion for arts and media. In my personal life, I enjoy drawing portraits and figures as well as painting surrealism and plein air. From these art forms, I seek to understand more about myself and the world around me.

I also have a passion for teaching others. Over the past 3 years, I have worked at the Coder School Yorba Linda. There I taught children ages 6 to 17 how to program in Scratch, Java, Python, GoDot, and Pico-8. Not only did I learn many of these language while I worked there, but I also found my love for teaching others. I recently left my position as Code Coach due to my big move across the country. However, I still ocassionally train new hires from time to time.

Here are some other somewhat interesting facts about myself. I was born and raised in California. My favorite animal is a hippo. I really enjoy horror movies. My favorite color is sunset pink. I like designing video games. My favorite video game is Stardew Valley. Finally, I really enjoy learning and practicing sustainabilty, gardening, and cooking.
