        <h1>Hydrate - A Case Study</h1>
        <p>See the full prototype <a href="https://youtu.be/Aq5cwD1tz0Y">here</a>!</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hydrate is an app that allows users to track their water intake and understand their hydration levels by watering a virtual plant throughout the day. This app was modeled after MyWater, which similarly allows users to track their water intake throughout the day and reach a hydration goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, I was tasked with designing and rebranding an app of my choice as well as develop the interactions for the app. This included analyzing the a task flow and app flow of MyWater and developing a high fidelity wireframe, wire flow, IX flow, interaction guides, an an animated prototype for Hydrate. The programs used for this design were Figma and Adobe After Effects.
        </p>

        <h2>The User</h2>
        <p>
            The user for this app would be someone in their early 20’s that are looking to build a better lifestyle. They may be very invested into fitness and making sure that they are staying hydrated throughout the day. Their needs include staying hydrated, keeping track of their water intake, and reaching their water goal. Their pain points include being forced to pay premium charge for important additions, too many unnecessary features such weight tracking and adding friends, and being unable to understand hydration levels throughout the day.
        </p>

        <h2>Task Flow and App Flow</h2>
        <p>
            Through dissecting the task flow and app flow of MyWater, it helped me understand each microinteraction that occurred. This also included breaking down the microinteraction into triggers, feedbacks, and rules to better understand the app has a whole and the individual interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tasks for MyWater were brokem down into 3 steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Clicking on the 'add drink' button</li>
            <li>Selecting a drink</li>
            <li>Adding the amount of drink consumed</li>
        </ol>
        <!--IMAGE-->

        <h2>Wireframes and Wire Flow</h2>
        <p>
            After understanding the task and app flow of MyWater, I was then able to develop low fidelity wireframes and a wire flow for my rebranding of the app. I decided to go with the concept of having the user water a plant throughout the day. This way, they could take care of a plant as they take care of their body. This would also give them a better visual queue to if they were staying hydrated throughout the day. A yellow and wilting plant would mean the user was dehydrated, and a green leafy plant would mean that the user was hydrated. To further tie in this aspect, as the user is getting closer to their water goal, the plant would grow to become a fully grown plant. Additionally, I wanted to simplify the step for adding the amount of drink consumed by allowing the user to tap on the numbers on the amount consumed screen rather than tapping on a button to manually input the amount.
        </p>

        <h2>IX Flow</h2>
        <p>
            To develop the IX flow, a high fidelity wireframe was created and the user’s key tasks when using Hydrate were identified.
        </p>
        <p>
            These key tasks include:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Opening the app.</li>
            <li>Pressing the "Hydrate" button.</li>
            <li>Selecting a drink.</li>
            <li>Adding amount consumed.</li>
            <li>Confirming beverage and amount.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            In developing the high fidelity wireframes, a pixel aesthetic was used for the app to give it a youthful aspect and make tracking water intake seem fun rather than a chore. Icons were added to to the different drink buttons so that the user could quickly recognize which beverage they wanted to add. Users could also swipe to find more drinks to select. Additionally, a goal achieved screen was added. This screen gave the user an affirmation for reaching their goal as well a a new plant for them to grow.
        </p>

        <h2>Interaction Guides</h2>
        <p>
            Before creating the interaction guides, multiple sketches were created to determine the best way to transition between tasks and screens. A vertical approach was determined to be the best way to transition between the key task since it would promote the theme of growth. However, the transition after clicking on the ‘hydrate now’ button included rain falling down and growing the plant since it would allow the land to smoothly fall back down into place. An addition to this transition included an image that would congratulate the user if they reached their water goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below are the 4 interaction guides.

        <h2>Animation</h2>
        <p>
            Adobe After Effects was used to create the animated prototype. All of the elements were imported from Figma. Along with creating the app’s animations, a grey circle was added to represent the user’s finger interaction with the app.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            I found this project to be a great exercise and challenge as it was my first time using Adobe After Effects. I really enjoyed how the project allowed me to explore rebranding as well as further understand the function and importance of microinteractions.
