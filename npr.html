        <h1>National Public Radio - A Case Study</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            National Public Radio is an independent, nonprofit media organization that was founded in 1970. Their mission is to create a more informed public. NPR are storytellers that connect across the country to explore the news, ideas, and what it means to be human. As they put it, “NPR makes local stories national, national stories local, and global stories personal” (npr.org).
        </p>
        <p>
            This case study will be exploring ways to better NPR in reaching their mission via their mobile, tablet, and desktop states of their website.
        </p>

        <h2>Userbase</h2>
        <p>
            The user base of NPR consists of active members of society who like to keep up with the news. They mostly lie in the political center, but may lean to the left. The user is also most likely to have a bachelor’s degree. They also listen to podcasts and are invested in their own growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user’s goals and interested may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Staying up to date with national and local news</li>
            <li>Exploring news, media, and ideas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The user’s pain points and concerns may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not having a convenient location to view general interests and current events</li>
            <li>Having accessible news across all platforms</li>
            <li>Having a personal connection to national and global news stories</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Heuristic Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            In analyzing NPR’s site in its mobile, tablet, and desktop state, it was notable that the website had strong trust and credibility, strong writing and content quality, weak navigation and IA, and a weak visual design.
        </p>
        <p>
            NPR’s trust and credibility scored very strongly due to the brand’s history and notability over the years. Same could be said for the writing and content quality. Many of NPR’s writers and talkshow hosts are popular and well known amongst the community. The navigation and IA felt overwhelming at times due to the organization of the search results and the articles as a whole.Visual design scored lower because of the inappropriate screen density for the target user and their tasks.
        </p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
            To begin the design process, I first created 8 research sketches. Each of them containing a mobile, tablet, and desktop design for the site. I drew upon themes that the company centers around such as togetherness, radio, and community.
        </p>
        <!--IMAGE-->
        <p>
            In addition to the sketches, I developed 3 style guides. Each with their own characteristics that I believed fit NPR.
        </p>
        <!--IMAGE-->
        <p>
            After this initial research process, I designed a low-fidelity wireframe which eventually evolved to the final high-fidelity wireframe.
        </p>

        <h2>Suggested Changes</h2>
        <p>
            The final design suggests to lean into NPR’s history with radio by having a circular images and rounded title sections. This theme can especially be seen in the top section of the home screen. Additionally, the article content is re-organized into 4 article categories and a podcast category. This provides more structure and organization to the overall site and a way for users to quickly find the content they want based on categories. The categories are also separated by color so that users who are scrolling quickly can recognize content based off of color rather than reading the titles. Additionally, the author of the articles were added to emphasize the storytelling theme that is evident in the brand and their writing style.
        </p>
        <p>
            These changes bring NPR’s mission and their users closer together and creates a more personal environment for the user.
